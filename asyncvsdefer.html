<!-- 
    normal :   HTML Parsing => JS script founded(block HTML Parsing) => JS downloading => JS execution => resume HTML Parsing
    async (do when order of scripts don't matter) :   HTML Parsing => JS script founded => JS downloading(HTML Parsing will be continue in background)  => JS execution(block HTML parsing) => resume HTML Parsing
    defer (do when order of scripts matter) :   HTML Parsing => JS script founded => JS downloading(HTML Parsing will be continue in background)  => JS execution(after HTML parsing done completely)

    Scripts with defer never block the page.
    Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready

    Async scripts are great when we integrate an independent third-party script into the page: counters, 
    ads and so on, as they don’t depend on our scripts, and our scripts shouldn’t wait for them: 
    Google Analytics is usually added like this -
    <script async src="https://google-analytics.com/analytics.js"></script>
